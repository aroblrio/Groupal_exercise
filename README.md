In this project we have made a calculator of the different subjects in the physics degree, for example, from analysis, statistic, physics and algebra. In order to run the program you need to download the "UAX calculator" folder, open Visual Studio Code with the previous folder. When you have the folder opened, press ctrl Ã± to open the console and then, run the program.
The different commands are:
-From Algebra:
  LinearAlgebra.matrix_sum(matrix 1,matrix 2), sum of 2 matrix.
  LinearAlgebra.matrix_multiply(matrix 1,matrix 2), multiply 2 matrix.
  LinearAlgebra.determinant(matrix 1), determinant of a matrix.
  LinearAlgebra.matrix_range(matrix 1), range of a matrix.
  LinearAlgebra.get_minor(matrix 1, row, column), eliminate the row and column you introduce.
-From Analysis:
